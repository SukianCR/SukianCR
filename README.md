Hello, my name is Susana, my nickname is Suki . I am a legal inmigrant from Costa Rica who's been in the USA for 8 years. I was a coder in my past (php, mysql) but i got rusty when I moved to the USA and had to work in other fields. I just graduated from Full Stack Web Academy where I was able to learn all the new ways and platforms used now day to do what I used to do. I'm currently a bartender in Las Vegas, I felt interest by mixology and decided to learn it, since I didn't know how to go back to IT. I always loved to code and I'm happy I finally learned what I needed to get back to coding . I have a lot of ideas for personal projects (related with art & culture) I always wanted to build . I'm also interested in coolaborating in open source projects related to art & culture .
